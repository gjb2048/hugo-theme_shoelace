## Who am I?

My website address is: `Website URL`.

## Cookies

This website does not use cookies.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.  Please refer to their respective privacy policies, such as:

* [SlideShare](www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)
* [YouTube](policies.google.com/privacy)

Where possible I will provide a link instead of embedding so that you may choose to go to the given website.  I am not responsible for the content of external websites.

## Analytics

I have not enabled analytics for the site, however, it is hosted by `Provider` which does collect data.  This is detailed, specifically under `‘Title’` on `URL`.
